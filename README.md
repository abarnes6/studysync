# StudySync

Get smart, get social.

## Project Overview

Students often struggle to find friends or classmates to study with, especially on short notice and with busy schedules. Simply knowing someone else is working on the same material nearby can boost motivation and create impromptu, productive study sessions.

StudySync is a mobile app that leverages location-tracking technology to connect students in a frictionless way, promoting spontaneous collaboration within designated study spots.

## Key Features

- Study Spot Designation: Users set their preferred study locations (library, specific cafes, campus buildings, etc.).
- Automatic Presence Detection: When a user enters a designated study spot, the app discreetly notes their presence.
- Friend Matching: StudySync cross-references users in the same study spot and compares their selected courses/subjects.
- Opt-In Notifications: If a potential study match is found, the app asks the user if they'd like to notify friends in that space.
- Friends-only Invites: Automatically ping friends when the user enters a common study space for over 5 minutes. Manual invites can also be sent to friends.
- Direct Messaging: Facilitates easy communication to coordinate a study session.
- Privacy Focus: Users control visibility and can choose to remain anonymous until they actively choose to connect.
